      <h2>A short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Currently transitioning careers from a Full Stack Web App Developer to a
        Software Development Engineer. Always being open to new challenges,
        ideas, and experiences has enabled me to have a diverse outlook on life
        and where I want to exist in it. I obtained an Associateâ€™s Degree with a
        3.92 GPA and a Web Application Development certificate with a 4.0 GPA. I
        am currently seeking any excuse to exercise my new found expertise.

      <h1 id="questionGame">You get to know only so much about me.</h1>
      <p>
        Anytime you meet someone new you ask that person several questions you
        expect them to answer. The problem is you never know if the narrator is
        trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following is a series of questions that I will ask you to answer
        about me. You are allowed to answer Yes or No only and you do not get to
        ask any questions back. You are quessing whether or not I have done what
        I am claiming.
