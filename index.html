      <h2>A short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Currently transitioning careers from a Full Stack Web App Developer to a Software Development Engineer. Always being open to new challenges, ideas, and experiences has enabled me to have a diverse outlook on life and where I want to exist in it. I obtained an Associate’s Degree with a 3.92 GPA and a Web Application Development certificate with a 4.0 GPA. I am currently seeking any excuse
        to exercise my new found expertise.

        Anytime you meet someone new you ask that person several questions you expect them to answer. The problem is you never know if the narrator is trustworthy.
