      <h2>A short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        Currently transitioning careers from a Full Stack Web App Developer to a
        Software Development Engineer. Always being open to new challenges,
        ideas, and experiences has enabled me to have a diverse outlook on life
        and where I want to exist in it. I obtained an Associateâ€™s Degree with a
        3.92 GPA and a Web Application Development certificate with a 4.0 GPA. I
        am currently seeking any excuse to exercise my new found expertise.

      <p>
        Anytime you meet someone new you ask that person several questions you
        expect them to answer. The problem is you never know if the narrator is
        trustworthy.

        The following is a series of questions you just guessed at and their
        answers.
